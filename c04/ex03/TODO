make character copies deep !replace copy of inventory to c-style array

make the imateria functions

dont understand "During copy, the Materias of a Character must be deleted before the new ones are added
to their inventory." --figure out later

test ex01 and ex02 on if new c-style array works. and do they need to be deep copies?

do nullptr checks

take out instand add to floor on AMateria's. doesnt work with .learnMateria()
